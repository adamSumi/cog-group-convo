00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I think we all know that.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
None of us were asleep in there.&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
He also said that if there is no

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
reasonable doubt, he must be found guilty.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Am I right?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And this kid is obviously guilty.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I say let's call for a vote.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Let's see where we stand.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Boy, oh boy.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
There's always one.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 He knifed his

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
own father 4 inches into the chest.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 They proved it a dozen different ways. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Do you want me to list them for you?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
What do you want?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
No hurry, but this case is pretty obvious.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Why, I was convinced the first day. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
What's there to talk about? He's guilty.
